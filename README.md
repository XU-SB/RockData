# RockData

**RockData** is an open-source project developed by Dr. Xu Shibo from JX Nippon, offering a Python package specifically designed for rock physics model building used for seismic response with elastic properties change with CO2 injection. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, including log data loading, data manipulation, saturation analysis, fluid substitution, and Gassmann equation implementation, among other essential functionalities for rock physics workflows.

## Installation

To install RockData, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XU-SB/RockData.git
```
The package is running on the Linux system

Please install the JupyterLab with the virtual machine for the full ustage of the package

## Main Features

- Log data loading and manipulation
- Saturation analysis
- Fluid substitution
- Gassmann equation implementation
- rock physics modeling
- output elastic property: Vp, Vs and Density for seismic response
